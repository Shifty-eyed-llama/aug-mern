  https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/

  Given two strings S and T containing only lowercase letters and "#" characters,
  return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors.

  # character means a backspace character.

  i.e., after processing the backspaces, are the two strings equal?


  Bonus: solve in O(n) time

  Examples:
  Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
  Output: true
  Explanation: Both S and T become "ac"

  Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
  Output: true
  Explanation: Both S and T become ""

  Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
  Output: true
  Explanation: Both S and T become "c"

{
// - 1 . *Take 100% of the exam time*.
// Do not drop out early, just because a bug is hard
// to find does not mean it takes a long time to fix!
}
{
  // - 2 . *Don't panic*, the only risk here is for you to find
  // and expose a weakness to study and correct.
}
{
//- 3. *Don't watch the clock*,
// set alarms for the midway point, last hour, last 15 minutes
}
{
// - 4. *Start with what you know*, save confusing bugs for the end,
// save black belt features for the end.
}
{
// - 5. *Don't start the exam until you have your enviroment and boilerplate ready* you know you will need a react app, with routing, and axios. you know you need a node server with mongodb. you know you need routing and server modules
}
{
// - 6. *Use the exam instructions as a checklist*,
// double check that against your app before submitting
// written exam instructions always supercede the wireframe and it's post-it notes
}
{
// - 7. *Don't overthink features* do exactly what the exam asks.
}
{
// - 8. *Use the platform* 100% of the redbelt features are covered across the platform and the MERN material
}
{
// - 9. *If you have trouble submitting* DELETE YOUR NODE_MODULES, BOTH OF THEM. one in project, one in client. bstanton@codingdojo.com
}
{
// - 10. *if you go over time, submit anyway, you will still get a code review*
}
{
// - 11. *always submit* you get a free code review!
}
{
// - 12. *no matter what, start the exam, take the wireframe, complete it before monday. we will be going over the wireframe monday morning. this will not be recorded
}
{
// - 13. *don't worry about the video*,
}
{
// - 14. *you must connect with me on zoom to have your exam graded*
}
{
// - 15. *join the lecture room so i can assign a breakout room*
}
{
// - 16. *there is no reason to cheat period full stop* you need to feel comfortable about what you do and do not know to survive in an engineering role.
